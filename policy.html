  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 8, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the Chrome extension <strong>"What is This"</strong>
    (hereinafter referred to as "the Extension") handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does <strong>not collect, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information</strong> (PII) from users. All user interactions happen locally within your browser environment.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Selected Text</strong>: The text you manually select on a webpage is temporarily processed to generate an explanation. It is not transmitted to any third-party service unless explicitly required to generate the answer (e.g., via a secure Cloudflare proxy to an AI model).</li>
    <li><strong>Saved Answers</strong>: Any answers you choose to save are stored <strong>locally in your browser's storage</strong> (`chrome.storage.local`). They are not uploaded or synced to any external server.</li>
    <li><strong>URLs</strong>: The Extension may store the URL of the page where the selection was made, strictly for your personal reference. This data also remains local.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. No Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does <strong>not share, sell, or transmit</strong> any user data to external servers, companies, or third parties. Your data remains fully under your control in the browser.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension may request access to read the content of pages you interact with (depending on context menu selection or permission model). This is solely used to process and explain selected content when initiated by you. We do not monitor or access your browsing activity beyond what is required for functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Use of AI Services</h2>
  <p>
    When generating answers, the Extension may securely forward the selected text to an AI model via a private proxy (e.g., Cloudflare Worker). No personally identifiable data is sent, and all communication is encrypted. We do not store or log any queries on our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    You may delete all saved content using the "Clear" button in the extension popup. All data is stored locally and can be fully removed at your discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If material changes are made, the revised version will be made available in the extension listing or on our official site.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
